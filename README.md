## Trepark

TrePark is an app for locating free parking spots in a city environment. By minimizing the time used for searching for parking spots TrePark will significantly decrease carbon emissions and make mobility of citizens more fluid and effortless. TrePark uses gamification to motiavate users: marking your parking will earn you free parking minutes on paid areas.

Detailed description:

The user is presented with mapped areas of local parking areas. The areas are color coded: green means there are plenty of spots left, yellow: some spots left and red: very few or none left. Tapping or clicking the areas will provide additional information on them.

The app has a geolocation function that shows the user’s location and whether the user is currently in bounds of a mapped parking area.

If the user is currently in a parking area, interacting with the ”Park here” button will decrease the capacity of that area by one spot. Leaving (not yet implemented) will increase the capacity by one.

The gamification system (not yet implemented):
- Marking your coming and going will earn you a few minutes of paid parking time.
- The user must verify via geolocation that they are at that spot.
- There is a time limit to avoid spamming the buttons.
- There is a daily limit to avoid abusing the system.
- The user cannot park at the same spot twice in a short time period.

The app is appliable to any city world wide, but we hope to get the opportunity to develop it further with the city of Tampere.
